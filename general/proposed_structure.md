# Proposed Podcast Structure

This is my propsed structure for the overall podcast.  We had been discussing doing appx 40 minutes to 1 hour, and I think this is entirely doable within that time frame.  I kind of stole this structure from one of my favorite podcasts, although entirely unrelated to this.

Heres the rundown:

* Intros (minute or two, I am kind of assuming that we'll have a rotating cast of people, and I would actually think that would be neat, so its kind of important for this)
* Topic 1 - some article of the week or something like that
** The first topic would be something like a neat article one of us saw, that we can apply to our own worklives, that either does something really awesome or does something really dumb.  See my ep1 recommendations for ideas.
* Topic 2 - Some interesting question that was seen on some blog somewhere
** Basically, some interesting StackOverflow/reddit/quora kind of question that might be semi-controversial, but can have a rousing discussion
* Topic 3 - a discussion about an end-to-end issue and what we did to solve it
** This is, by far, the most flexible.  I dont think we need to do it every time, but it might be interesting to try and abstract what we did during the week that caused us an issue, and talk about it.
* Jim Throws Shoes
** Basically, Jim comes up with some controversial topic that angers(or not) him, and we fight about it.

# Our Rotating cast of data dummies

I think that, for this to be the most interesting, and to be able to get the most out of it with the team we have, we can fill a few spots every week:

* Data Scientist - the guy doing the modelling.  A Jim or Alex or Anthony type
* The crossover - I was thinking primarily Jim here, but anyone, really, who does both the modelling and the presentation
* The clienter - whoever turns the raw data science work into something the client can understand.  Probably someone on CustSuccess. Or something.
* Data Engineer - someone talking about how to wrangle the crappy data into something better.
* [Insert clever name here] - Someone who can take what the DS team has done and turn it into something that can be productionalized.  I think this could be one of the more interesting parts because so few people talk about how to take the output of a data science and turn it into an automated thing that makes money.  Clearly thinking about myself there.


I dont know how relevant all of this actually is, but I think that kind of mix (even if a few of them are merged) wouold make it more interesting to listen to - especially, from my perspective, because I dont know enough about the modelling and want to learn a lot more.

# Finding the Ideas

I'm hoping to use this git repo as the main collaboration for now - eventually, I want to move it to a forum but that will take way more time than I want to.  For now, I suggest we fork this and do PR's and Issues to do the discussions.

I think the best way to do it would be to have a MarkDown page for each week where we nominate articles, just giving the link, a short description, and a compelling reason, and then once they are 'decided' on as much as they can be, create folder for each article that contain the article, and with a notes page for each person.
