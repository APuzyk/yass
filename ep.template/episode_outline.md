# Episode \d Episode Outline

This is a sample outline for the episode.

* Introductions
    * This will be a list of the people involved in the episode - a signup list I guess?
        * Jon Bruno
    * Special Guests
        * If we get so lucky
* Part One
    * Where we discuss the first 'article', which I'm thinking that, as of now, we won't actually mention the link itself that we are talking about.
    * Some simple talking points, stuff we definitely want to hit, etc
* Part two
    * Maybe this is where Jim throws shoes.  probably.
* Part the Third
    * This is, I think, the one where we talk about the question from stack or whatever, or some general bad idea from a blog post or something
    * I think this is only going to be a couple minutes.
* Part 4
    * If we have it, the work-related thing thats been abstracted away from knowing what we do and stuff.
* Part 5
    * I think it would be cool to do a favorite module or package or whatever for the week
